# Overview

I decided to put on the challenge of learning swift in two weeks!
I had the great idea of creating a flashcard app "Piece of Code" with the hope to teach you how to ACE coding interviews.

two weeks looks like have not been enough for my big idea, hence, I am learning swift from 0 that has make it a little challenging.

rigth now I am succesfully creating new folders.

for some reason when creating new folder, the add flashcard options is outiside of the folders and ts not saving anywhere.
I tried manually adding some, but that look like did not do anything...anyways, I'll keep working on it
