# Overview

I decided to put on the challenge of learning swift in two weeks!
I had the great idea of creating a flashcard app "Piece of Code" with the hope of teaching you how to ACE coding interviews.

two weeks look like have not been enough for my big idea, hence, I am learning swift from 0 which has made it a little challenging.

Right now I am successfully creating new folders.

for some reason when creating a new folder, the add flashcard option is outside of the folders and is not saving anywhere.
I tried manually adding some, but that looks like did not do anything...anyways, I'll keep working on it

# Development Environment

I used Xcode for this project and the SwiftUI library allows us to design apps in a declarative way.
